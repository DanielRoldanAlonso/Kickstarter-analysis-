#An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
In this project, we are helping Louise understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. We will be doing so by creating and utilizing multiple analysis tools on Excel. Through these tools, we can gather, organize, and display data to determine the relationship of these campaigns.  
The first deliverable was to find the outcomes based on launch dates. To have more data, we added a "Year" column to the sheet to have the ability to see the outcomes of plays by month in any given year.
