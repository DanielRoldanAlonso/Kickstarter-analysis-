# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview 

In this project, we are helping Louise understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. This is all to visualize campaign performances to improve decision making. To help Louise, we conducted our analysis by creating and utilizing multiple tools on Excel. Through these tools we gathered, organized, and displayed data to determine why campaigns succeeded, failed or got canceled.

## Analysis and Challenges

The first deliverable was to find the outcomes based on launch dates. To find the initation of these projects we needed more data, so we added a "Year" column to the sheet to later have the ability to see the monthly performance in any given year. Then by using a pivot table, we organized our information to identify the total amount of outcomes of these campaigns at every month throughout Louise's lifetime. To better understand which months performed better, we created a line chart  from the table to organize the data in a much more visual way. As you can see from the chart below, "Theatre Outcomes Based on Goals", the data shows us the amount of different outcomes per month from all years.

The second deliverable was to find the outcomes based on goals for plays. We conducted this analysis by creating a range of the amount of goal money, identifying the amount of outcomes from these ranges, and then converted these numbers into percentages. To find the amount of outcomes based on the goal range, we used the "COUNTIFS" function. This tool allowed us to populate the success, failed, and cancelled outcomes by adding specific filters that aligned to its category. After, we used basic math by dividing each outcome by its total to have a percentage. We convert to percentages as they are easier to understand than whole numbers. Once again, to further ilustrate the results we created a line chart below, "Outcomes Based on Goals", to visualy see the trend of the ouctome of plays based on the amount of goal money.

In both analysis we faced a few challenges. For the outcomes based on launch date, there were some difficultes identifying the fields and where to place them for the pivot table. It took some experimenting and reviewing to find what values to use and where to locate them. For the outcomes based on goals, we faced a challenge as we were locating information in the original sheet by simply using the filter tool. However, this is a slower process and the goal money range could not filter properly to the conditions. This was solved by using the "COUNTIFS" tool and adding all appropriate properties. 

## Results

From our results on the theatre outcomes by launch date, it is clear that in May and June, theater campaigns had much more success. We can also conclude that December had the least amount of succesful campaigns and almost had as many failed projects. Based on this, we recommened Louise to continue launching theatre campaigns in the months of May and June and not start them in December. For the outcomes based on goals, we can conclude that plays that have a goal of less than a $1,000 tend to have more success. With a success rate of 76%, we suggest Louise to have a lower goal to ensure a higher number of achievable plays. However, there are some limitations to both dataset. For example, plays do not have a canceled outcome so we're unsure of its performance with different goal ranges. As well, there seemed to be an increase in success from the higher goal range of $35,000 to $49,000 even though the trend line was going down from the start. This could be from many different reasons. The same could be said for the theater outcomes based on launch date. Its performance could not only be determined by the date but possibly other conditions. In our analysis we only used line charts, but we could have possibly used some other possible tables or graphs to sort our data. For example, when using percentages in the outcomes based on goals, it could have been useful to use pie charts for each goal range. Also, bar charts are a good tool to use for both cases when seeing information vertically.
