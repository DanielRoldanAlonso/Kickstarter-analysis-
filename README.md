# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview 

In this project, we are analyzing the outcomes based on launch date for theaters and then the outcomes based on goals for plays. We are helping Louise understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. This is all to visualize campaign performances to improve decision making. To help Luoise, we will be conducting our analysis by creating and utilizing multiple tools on Excel. Through these tools, we can gather, organize, and display data to determine the relationship of these campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

The first deliverable was to find the outcomes based on launch dates. To have more data, we added a "Year" column to the sheet to have the ability to see the outcomes of plays by month in any given year. Then by using a pivot table, we can organize our information to identify the total amount of campaigns that succeeded, failed, and canceled at every month throughout Louise's lifetime. To better understand which months perform better, we create a line chart from the table to organize the data in a much more visual way.

The second deliverable was to find the outcomes based on goals for plays.

## Results

From our results of the outcomes based on launch date, it is clear that in May and June, theater campaigns had much more success. We can also conclude that December had the least amount of succesful campaigns and almost had as many failed projects. Based on this, we recommened Louise to continue launching theatre campaigns in the months of May and June and not start them in December. For the outcomes based on goals for plays, we can conclude that plays that have a goal of less than a $1,000 tend to have more success. With a success rate of 76%, we suggest Louise to have a lower goal to ensure a higher number of achievable plays.
